*A distant flock drifts over a slowly evolving seascape, accompanied by an abstract piano soundtrack.*

##Wuh?##

An experiment. It uses a couple of workers for the flock and background processing, then draws to a fairly large canvas, so is not particularly mobile friendly... 
However it runs quite nicely as a native Android app or Windows exe if you feel like building it yourself. It may well build to other platforms supported by OpenFL, I have not tried.
